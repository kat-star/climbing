Welcome to Climb Finder, a command line database application that allows you to keep track of your outdoor rock climbing climbs and view routes. Topics that encapsulate our project are module one fundamentals that include Object-Oriented Ruby, SQL, and Active Record. 

We built our Climber, Route, and Climb models from scratch with an interactive command line interface. A climber has many climbs and a climb belongs to a climber, a climber has many routes through climbs, and climbs belong to a climber and route. Routes has many climbers through climbs and has many climbs. 

Our User (Climber) Stories:

1. Climbers can create, add, update, or delete a climb theyâ€™ve created
2. Climbers can search for routes by location
3. Climbers can look at other climbers from various locations
4. Climbers can view routes by rating
